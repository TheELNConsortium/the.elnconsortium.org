# Community

The standard is community driven, and all members have equal say in how we design and implement the specification.

We meet every 2 months virtually to discuss various topics related to the .eln file format.

Meetings are announced on our Discussions section: [Consortium Meetings](https://github.com/TheELNConsortium/TheELNFileFormat/discussions/categories/consortium-meetings).
