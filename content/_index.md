# Driving standards for interoperable electronic lab notebooks.

The ELN Consortium is a collaborative community of electronic lab notebook
(ELN) providers, researchers, and institutions working together to define and
adopt open standards for data and metadata interchange. At its core, the
Consortium enables research data to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable (FAIR) by promoting specification development, shared formats and best
practices across the ELN ecosystem.

The Consortium’s primary goal is to develop common specifications — such as
exchange file formats, shared metadata schemas and interoperability frameworks
— that allow different ELN systems to exchange data seamlessly. While the
initiative supports open-source solutions, it also welcomes proprietary
platforms, fostering an inclusive environment for all ELN stakeholders.

Through this collaborative effort, the ELN Consortium empowers institutions and
researchers to build reproducible, transparent and sustainable digital research
infrastructures — ensuring that digital records of experiments, protocols and
results can be shared across systems and reused across time.
